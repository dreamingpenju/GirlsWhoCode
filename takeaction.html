Mayor Adams,</br>
The potential $8.3 billion borough based jail program will be detrimental to New Yorkers, current and future. It will cause irreversible harm and using public</br> funds to further mass incarceration is not the answer. We ask that you halt the construction of the borough based jail, especially Chinatown’s mega</br> jail and consider alternative options. Constructing the tallest jail in the world will change the fabric of the community, diminish quality of life </br>for residents, and cause harm for an already marginalized community. I urge you to stop the demolition of Manhattan Detention Center and construction of </br>the mega jail in Chinatown. </br>
